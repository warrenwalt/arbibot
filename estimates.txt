Back-of-the-envelope calculations

Worst case:

> there are 175 active bookmakers in the world.
> each match (with outcomes of 3. 3 is the max outcome we are supporting).
> this will use an avg of 42mb worth of possible combinations (this is a rough estimate) for a single match.
> On avg (a very rough estimate) we will be doing 500 matches per 5 minutes!
> this summates to 21GB of data every 5 minutes

NB: THIS IS WORST CASE. this is because we arent supporting 175 bookies


AVERAGE CASE:

> We'll have 3 bookmakers
> each match (with outcomes of 3. 3 is the max outcome we are supporting).
> this will use an avg of 0.312 KB worth of possible combinations (this is a rough estimate) for a single match.
> On avg (a very rough estimate) we will be doing 500 matches per 5 minutes!
> this summates to 156 KB of data every 5 minutes

We gonn' need to optimize fetching pages:
    1. store links to the target page, so as to go there directly
